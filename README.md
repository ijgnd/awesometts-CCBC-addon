# AwesomeTTS Anki add-on

AwesomeTTS makes it easy for language-learners and other students to add
speech to their personal [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) card decks.

Once loaded into the Anki `addons` directory, the AwesomeTTS add-on code
enables both on-demand playback and recording functionality.
