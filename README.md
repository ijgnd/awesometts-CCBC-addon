# Awesomo and AwesomeTTS

## AWESOM-O (Application)
Awesomo is a wrapper that launches AwesomeTTS without the need for Anki. This allows the program to be used independent of Anki allowing more creative applications such as a screen reader or clipboard text reader.

Supermemo users may find this useful as there isn't a need to download 150mb of useless files just to use AwesomeTTS.


## AwesomeTTS (Library)
AwesomeTTS makes it easy for language-learners and other students to add
speech to their personal [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) card decks.

Once loaded into the Anki `addons` directory, the AwesomeTTS add-on code
enables both on-demand playback and recording functionality.
